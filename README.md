  <b> Chicago Housing Search Tool </b><br>
</h1>

This repo is meant to coalesce different housing resources to aide in searching for housing in Chicago.  The goal is to collect all the listings daily, then upload them to a gsheet that i can sift through individually.  We'll also be making use of [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com) to make calls to the zillow api, then run manual searches on the other two sites.
