#TODO -
# Build this file out to visualize and sort through different dates
# I'd like to have a date select function.  Make it like the slider.py

# Same basic grid layout as slider.py, but the bottom timeline now
# is controlled by datetime.  Not sure how the units will work for that
# might have to use a ref list and keep track of the idx as a global var
# 
# Optional sort conditions.  
    # 1. Be able to sort by most recent, or oldest
    # 2. Have a pop up that shows listing information...
    # 3. Color code cities/zips by amount of listings found.  
    # 4. Have a time window select of the last day, week, month.
    # 5. Be able to save a home so that it always shows up when you're searching.
        # 5b. If a home is saved, go to the individual 
        # page (not sure which source) and save the rest of the 
        # information about the house. 
        # TODO - Figure out all the metrics you would want for a house

    # 6. Export button for saved homes.  
    # 7. Filter by site.
    # 8. If duplicate addresses found, maybe color code the point to how many of the 4 sites its on.   
    # 9. Or have the ability to select quantiles of attributes by site.
