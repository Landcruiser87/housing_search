#TODO -
# Build this file out to visualize and sort through different dates
# I'd like to have a date select function.  Make it like the slider.py

# Same basic grid layout as slider.py, but the bottom timeline now
# is controlled by datetime.  Not sure how the units will work for that
# might have to use a ref list and keep track of the idx as a global var
# 
# Optional sort conditions.  
# 1. Be able to sort by most recent, or oldest
# 2. Have a pop up that shows listing information...
# 3. Color code cities/zips by amount of listings found.  
# 4. Have a time window select of the last day, week, month.
# 5. Be able to save a home so that it always shows up
    # when you're searching.  
# 6. Export button for saved homes.  
# 7. Filter by site.
# 8. If duplicate addresses found... just show it on zillow?
