#For looking at housing data over the past few years. 
#Could chart a few different variables, 

#Main things i want.  

#Slider on the bottom to navigate time. 
    #Gonna be a bitch with datetimes. 
    #Time regrouping.  Need resolutions at the day, week, month level for changing trend

#Dual charts residing above. 
#On the left.
    #Main map chart.  (plotly would be better here but lets be OG MPL)
    #For the time period selected, show possible rent dots 
    #Could use a span selector on the brokebarh.  
    #That would be sweet. and would take care of my time regrouping needs all in one object. 
    # I might need neighborhood polygons for htis which could get tricky

#On the right - Option button to the right to flip between the following
    #Show price trend.  Tie that to the brokebarh as well for time selection
    #Neighborhood listing frequencies.  Break out the top 10 neighborhoods in a bar chart maybe?
    #Safety ratings?
        #Data won't be as complete, but would be interesting to see. 

#On the bottom
#Brokebarh chart with a time span selector.
